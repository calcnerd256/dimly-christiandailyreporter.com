This README is plaintext because I don't like Markdown.

This repository hosts the source code and generated output of a spider.
A spider is a robot that scrapes the Web.
This spider only scrapes a single website, and only its home page.
The script expects to be run from cron.  I'm running it hourly at home.

If any of this is incomprehensible, ask.
You can send me a pull request, which I will likely reject, or you can e-mail me.

The overarching project is called "Dimly", because it attempts to mirror things.

I've stopped running this, because Adam Ford maintains his own archives now, so there won't be more updates to this repo unless something changes.
